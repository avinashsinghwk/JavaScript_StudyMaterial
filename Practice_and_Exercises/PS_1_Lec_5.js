         //Question 1. Create a variable of type string and try to add a number to it

        let name = "Avinash"
        // let num = 53
        // console.log(name + num)


        //Question 2. Use typeof operator to find the datatype of the string in last question

        // console.log(typeof name)


        
        //Question 3. Create a const object in javaScript, Can you change it to hold a number letter

        const food = {
            fruit: "Apple",
            vegetable: "Potato",
            meat: "Chicken"
        }
        // food = 43;
        // So, We can not change a const variable



        //Question 4. Try to add a new key to the const object in problem 3, Are you able to do it?

        food["language"] = "English"
        // console.log(food["meat"])
        // console.log(food["language"])
        // Yes we can add a key or even can change a value because we are not changing the value of food we are changing or adding the value in object



        //Question 5. Write a JS program to create a word meaning dictonary of 5 words.

        //     Prejudice : "One who judge someone without knowing about",
        //     Misogamist : "One who hates marriage",
        //     Procrastination : "One who delay his work",
        //     Entrepreneuship : "Starting your own business"
        // }
        // console.log(dictonary["Entrepreneuship"])
        // console.log(dictonary.Mad)
